Hi there! 

My name is Jared Burke, and I am student at NYU studying computer science and neuroscience 
While being a research assistant, I discovered a passion about utilzing machine learning to drive better decisions that can positively impact a vast number of people
Currently, to not only grow as programmer but as a problem solver, I work and finish a project a day (6 Days and counting!)

I enjoy connecting with members of both the CS and Neuroscience community plese feel free to connect!
