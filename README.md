Hi there! 

My name is Jared Burke, and I am student at NYU studying computer science and neuroscience.
While being a research assistant, I discovered a passion for engineering and building things that can help a wide number of people. Currently, my interest lie in data science as well as full stack development.  
I enjoy connecting with others who are working on interesting problems whether it be in neuroscience or tech feel free to connect.
